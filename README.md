# Unit Converter / Calculator
My first app idea was to make a unit converter app, so I decided to chop up my program into chunks.
Based on the layout of my unit converter app, I first decided that I would explore how to link my buttons on the bottom to numbers. I thought that the best way to do this would be to create a new app on a different project, then implement the ideas onto my unit converter app later. So I created a calculator app, and learned about how to implement *buttons* on swift (using xcode) via dragging and dropping using the control key. I soon also discovered tags, which made buttons much easier to handle, as you can label every button with a tag number. I also created a method that enables the user to create a number with a decimal.
Next, I have to place these ideas into the unit converter app, and figure out how to control the scroller bar.
