# Unit Converter
I have no idea how to use git hub for swift apps (or anything in general) BUT this is where I am planning to post my code for the apps that I decide to create!
My first app idea was to make a unit converter app, because it seemed like something *relatively* easy to actually create a finished product that worked in some shape or form, but as this was my first app, I soon realized this would be way easier said than done. Creating something in a programming language I was unfamiliar with is frustrating, so I decided to chop up my program into chunks.
Based on the layout of my unit converter app, I first decided that I would explore how to link my buttons on the bottom to numbers. I thought that the best way to do this would be to create a new app on a different project, then implement the ideas onto my unit converter app later. So I created a calculator app, and learned about how to implement *buttons* on swift (using xcode) via dragging and dropping using the control key. I soon also discovered tags, which made buttons much easier to handle, as you can label every button with a tag number. Eventually, a beautiful, buggy calculator was born! I still need to create a method that enables the user to create a number with a decimal, but it does most of the job quite fine.
Next, I have to place these ideas into the unit converter app, and figure out how to control the scroller bar.
